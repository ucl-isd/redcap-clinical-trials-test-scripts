Feature: A.2.3.0100. Assign administrators and account managers

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Control Center is functioning as expected

    Scenario: A.2.3.0100.100 View administrator accounts
        #REDUNDANT - Tested in A.2.3.0200.100

        # Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        # And I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        # And I click on the link labeled "Administrator Privileges"
        # Then I should see "Set REDCap Administrator Privileges"
        # And I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the administrators table:
        #     | Administrators          |
        #     | Test_Admin (Admin User) |
#END
