Feature: A.2.2.600 Add/Manage users

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Users failed login lockout is functioning as expected.

    Scenario: A.2.2.600.100 User account locked out after too many attempts
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        And I click on the link labeled "Security & Authentication"
        Then I should see "Security & Authentication Configuration"

        #FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION Setup the failed login attempts

        And I enter "1" into the input field labeled "Number of failed login attempts before user is locked out for a specified amount of time, which is set below."
        And I clear the field labeled "Amount of time user will be locked out after having failed login attempts exceeding the limit set above."
        And I enter "2" into the input field labeled "Amount of time user will be locked out after having failed login attempts exceeding the limit set above."
