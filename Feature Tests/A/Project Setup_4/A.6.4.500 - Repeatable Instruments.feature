Feature: Control Center: The system shall support the option to limit adding or modifying repeatable instruments while in production to administrators

      As a REDCap end user
      I want to see that repeatable function is functioning as expected

      Scenario: A.6.4.500.100 User's ability to add or modify repeatable instrument while in production mode
            #SETUP_PROJECT
            Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
            And I create a new project named "A.6.4.500.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
            When I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
            And I click on the link labeled "A.6.4.500.100"
            #SETUP_USER
            And I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
            And I enter "Test_User1" into the field with the placeholder text of "Assign new user to role"
            And I click on the button labeled "Assign to role"
            And I select "1_FullRights" on the dropdown field labeled "Select Role" on the role selector dropdown
            And I click on the button labeled exactly "Assign" on the role selector dropdown

            Then I should see "Test User1" within the "1_FullRights" row of the column labeled "Username" of the User Rights table

            #SETUP_PRODUCTION
            Given I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
            And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
