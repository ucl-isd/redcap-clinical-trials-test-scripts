Feature: A.2.2.800 Add/Manage users

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that amount of inactivity time before auto logout time is functioning as expected.

    Scenario: A.2.2.800.100 User account locked time
        #SETUP control center Auto logout time
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        And I click on the link labeled "Security & Authentication"
        Then I should see "Security & Authentication Configuration"

        When I clear the field labeled "Auto logout time"
        And I enter "4" into the input field labeled "Auto logout time"
        And I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
        Then I should see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"

        Given I logout

        #SETUP timeout warning
