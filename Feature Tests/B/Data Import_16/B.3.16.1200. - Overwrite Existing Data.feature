Feature: User Interface: The system shall provide the option to allow blank values to overwrite existing saved values.

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Data import is functioning as expected

  Scenario: B.3.16.1200.100 Data import overwrite existing values with blank

    #SETUP
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
    #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
    And I create a new project named "B.3.16.1200.100 LTS 14.5.26" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    #SETUP_PRODUCTION
    When I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
    And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
    And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
    Then I should see Project status: "Production"

    ##Verify Data present
