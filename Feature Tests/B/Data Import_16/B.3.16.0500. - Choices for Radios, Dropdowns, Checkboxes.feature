Feature: User Interface: The system shall import only valid choice codes for radio buttons, dropdowns, and checkboxes.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data import is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.3.16.0500.100 Import valid choice codes fields

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "B.3.16.0500.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_3.16.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        When I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
        Then I see Project status: "Production"

        When I click on the link labeled "Data Import Tool"
        And I upload a "csv" format file located at "import_files//B.3.16.0500_DataImport_Rows.csv", by clicking the button near "Upload your CSV file:" to browse for the file, and clicking the button labeled "Upload File" to upload the file
        Then I should see "Your document was uploaded successfully and is ready for review"

        When I click on the button labeled "Import Data"
        Then I should see "Import Successful!"

        #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION:  incorrect format
        When I upload a "csv" format file located at "import_files//B.3.16.0500_DataImport_Rows Bad.csv", by clicking the button near "Upload your CSV file:" to browse for the file, and clicking the button labeled "Upload File" to upload the file
        Then I should see "Errors were detected in the import file that prevented it from being loaded"

        And I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Record | Field Name               | Value |
            | 300    | multiple_dropdown_auto   | 99    |
