Feature: B.4.9.0100. User Interface: The system shall support branching logic for data entry forms.
    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Branching Logic is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.4.9.0100.100 Branching Logic
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "B.4.9.0100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_4.9.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        ##VERIFY: Branching logic
        When I click on the link labeled "Designer"
        And I click on the instrument labeled "Data Types"
        Then I should see "Branching logic: [record_id] = '999'" within the field with variable name "ptname"
        Then I should see "Branching logic: [record_id] = '999'" within the field with variable name "textbox"
        Then I should see "Branching logic: [record_id] = '999'" within the field with variable name "text2"
        Then I should see "Branching logic: [record_id] = '999'" within the field with variable name "notesbox"
