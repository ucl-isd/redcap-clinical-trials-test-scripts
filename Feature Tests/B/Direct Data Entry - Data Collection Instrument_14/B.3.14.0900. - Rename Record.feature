Feature: Renaming a Record: The system shall allow users to rename a record.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that rename record is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.3.14.0900.100 Rename record
        #ATS prerequisite: Normal users cannot move projects to production by default - let's adjust that before we proceed.
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        And I click on the link labeled "User Settings"
        Then I should see "System-level User Settings"
        Given I select "Yes, normal users can move projects to production" on the dropdown field labeled "Allow normal users to move projects to production?"
        When I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
        And I see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"
        Then I logout

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
        And I create a new project named "B.3.14.0900.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_3.14.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        Then I should see Project status: "Production"

        #SET UP_USER_RIGHTS
        When I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
        And I enter "Test_User1" into the field with the placeholder text of "Assign new user to role"
        And I click on the button labeled "Assign to role"
        And I select "1_FullRights" on the dropdown field labeled "Select Role" on the role selector dropdown
        When I click on the button labeled exactly "Assign" on the role selector dropdown
        Then I should see "Test User1" within the "1_FullRights" row of the column labeled "Username" of the User Rights table

        ##VERIFY - INITIAL RECORD ROW IN REPORT
