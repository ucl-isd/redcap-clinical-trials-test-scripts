Feature: Creating a Record and Entering Data: The system shall support data entry for the defined core field types.

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that data entry for field type is functioning as expected

  Scenario: B.3.14.0200.100 Appropriate data entry by field type
    #ATS prerequisite: Normal users cannot move projects to production by default - let's adjust that before we proceed.
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
    When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
    And I click on the link labeled "User Settings"
    Then I should see "System-level User Settings"
    Given I select "Yes, normal users can move projects to production" on the dropdown field labeled "Allow normal users to move projects to production?"
    When I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
    And I see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"
    Then I logout

    #SETUP
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1_CTSP"
    And I create a new project named "B.3.14.0200.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_3.14.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
    And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
    Then I should see Project status: "Production"

    #SETUP
    Given I click on the link labeled "Add / Edit Records"
    And I click on the button labeled "Add new record for the arm selected above"
    And I click the bubble to add a record for the "Data Types" longitudinal instrument on event "Event 1"
    Then I should see "Adding new Record ID 7"

    And I select the checkbox option "Checkbox2" for the field labeled "Checkbox"

    Given I click on the link labeled "Add signature"
    And I see a dialog containing the following text: "Add signature"
    And I draw a signature in the signature field area
