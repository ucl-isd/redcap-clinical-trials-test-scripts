Feature: User Interface: The logging module shall record all changes with username, timestamp, actions, and list of data changes/fields exported.

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Logging Module is functioning as expected

  Scenario: B.2.23.0100.100 Logging module records changes
  #This feature test has been deemed REDUNDANT by UCL as it has already been tested in A.6.4.0400
  
    #SETUP
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    And I create a new project named "B.2.23.0100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
    When I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
    And I click on the link labeled "B.2.23.0100.100"

    #SETUP_PRODUCTION
    When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
    And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
    And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far." in the dialog box
    And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
    Then I should see Project status: "Production"

    #FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
    ##ACTION: Logging Module
    When I click on the link labeled "Logging"
    ##VERIFY
    Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the logging table:
      | Time / Date      | Username   | Action        | List of Data Changes OR Fields Exported |
      | mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm | test_admin | Manage/Design | Move project to Production status       |
#END
