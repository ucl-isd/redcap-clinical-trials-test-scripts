Feature: User Interface: The system shall support ranges for the following data types:  Date (Y-M-D) | Datetime (Y-M-D H:M) | Datetime w/seconds (Y-M-D H:M:S) | Integer | Number | Number (1 Decimal Place,  comma as decimal) | Time (HH:MM)  | Time (MM:SS) | Time (HH:MM:SS)

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Field validation is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.4.8.300.100 Field range validation

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
        And I create a new project named "B.4.8.300.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_4.8.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box
        Then I should see Project status: "Production"

        ##VERIFY_CODEBOOK
        When I click on the link labeled "Codebook"
        And I click on the button labeled "Expand all instruments"
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the codebook table:
