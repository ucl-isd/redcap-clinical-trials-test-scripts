Feature: User Interface: The system shall support text validation for text field types: Date (Y-M-D) | Datetime (Y-M-D H:M) | Datetime w/seconds (Y-M-D H:M:S) |  Email  | Integer | Numbers | Number (1 decimal place - comma as decimal) | Time (HH:MM)  | Time (MM:SS) | Time (HH:MM:SS)

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Field validation is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.4.8.0200.100 Field validation type
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "B.4.8.0200.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_4.8.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
        Then I should see "Project Setup"

        #SETUP _PRODUCTION
        When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
