  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that export data is functioning as expected

  Scenario: B.5.21.0400.100 Export select forms
    #SETUP
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    And I create a new project named "B.5.21.0400.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT
    ##ACTION: export CSV and confirm column
    When I click on the link labeled "Data Exports, Reports, and Stats"
    Then I should see a table row containing the following values in the reports table:
      | A | All data (all records and fields) |

    When I click on the "Make custom selections" button for the "Selected instruments" report in the My Reports & Exports table
    And I select "Text Validation" on the multiselect field labeled "Instruments"
    And I select "Event 1 (Arm 1: Arm 1)" on the multiselect field labeled "Events"
    And I click on the "Export Data" button for the "Selected instruments" report in the My Reports & Exports table
    And I click on the radio labeled "CSV / Microsoft Excel (raw data)" in the dialog box
    And I click on the button labeled "Export Data" in the dialog box
    Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Data export was successful!"

    Given I click on the download icons to receive the files for the "CSV / Microsoft Excel (raw data)" format in the dialog box
    Then I should have a "csv" file that contains the headings below
