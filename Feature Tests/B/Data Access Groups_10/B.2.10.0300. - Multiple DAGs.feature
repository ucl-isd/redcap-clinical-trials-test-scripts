Feature: B.2.10.0300. User Interface: The system shall allow a user to be added to more than one DAG.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data Access Groups is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.2.10.0300.100 Assign user multiple DAGs and DAG Switcher
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "B.2.10.0300.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
        When I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
        And I click on the link labeled "B.2.10.0300.100"
        And I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
        And I click on the button labeled "Upload or download users, roles, and assignments"
        Then I should see "Upload users (CSV)"

        When I click on the link labeled "Upload users (CSV)"
        Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Upload users (CSV)"

        Given I upload a "csv" format file located at "import_files/user list for project 1_CTSP.csv", by clicking the button near "Select your CSV" to browse for the file, and clicking the button labeled "Upload" to upload the file
        Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Upload users (CSV) - Confirm"

            | username   |
            | test_user1_CTSP |
            | test_user2_CTSP |
