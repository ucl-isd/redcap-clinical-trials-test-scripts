    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data Access Groups is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.2.10.0600.100 Unique DAGs

        #SETUP

        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
        And I create a new project named "B.2.10.0600.100 LTS 14.5.26" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
        When I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
        And I click on the link labeled "B.2.10.0600.100"

        #FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION: Record assigned DAG
        Given I click on the link labeled "Add / Edit Records"
        When I select record ID "3" from arm name "Arm 1: Arm 1" on the Add / Edit record page
        Then I should see "Record Home Page"

        Given I click on the span element labeled "Choose action for record"
        And I click on the link labeled "Assign to Data Access Group"
        Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Assign record to a Data Access Group?"

        When I select "TestGroup1" on the dropdown field labeled "Assign record" on the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "Assign to Data Access Group" in the dialog box
        Then I should see "Record ID 3 was successfully assigned to a Data Access Group"

        Then I should see "Record Home Page"
        And I should see "TestGroup1"

        Given I click on the link labeled "Add / Edit Records"
        When I select record ID "4" from arm name "Arm 1: Arm 1" on the Add / Edit record page
        Then I should see "Record Home Page"

        Given I click on the span element labeled "Choose action for record"
        And I click on the link labeled "Assign to Data Access Group"
        Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Assign record to a Data Access Group?"

        When I select "TestGroup2" on the dropdown field labeled "Assign record" on the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "Assign to Data Access Group" in the dialog box
        Then I should see "Record ID 4 was successfully assigned to a Data Access Group"

        Then I should see "Record Home Page"
        And I should see "TestGroup2"

        ##VERIFY_DE
        Given I click on the link labeled "Data Exports, Reports, and Stats"

        When I click on the button labeled "View Report"
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the report data table:
            | Record ID | Data Access Group |
            | 1         |                   |
            | 2         |                   |
            | 3         | TestGroup1        |
