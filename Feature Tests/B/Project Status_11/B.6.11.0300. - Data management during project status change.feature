Feature: User Interface: The system shall support the ability for a user to keep or remove all record data during project status change from Development to Production.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that My Project is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.6.11.0300.100 Move project from development to production while keeping data
        #SETUP - Important: the manual test had this user listed as 'Test_User1' which is not correct.
        # Needs to be Test_Admin to guarantee we can move to production immediately ...
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "B.6.11.0300.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION: move to production
        When I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
        And I click on the link labeled "B.6.11.0300.100"

        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
        ##VERIFY
        Then I should see Project status: "Production"

        ##VERIFY_RSD:
        When I click on the link labeled "Record Status Dashboard"
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the record status dashboard table:
            | Record ID |
            | 1         |
            | 2         |
