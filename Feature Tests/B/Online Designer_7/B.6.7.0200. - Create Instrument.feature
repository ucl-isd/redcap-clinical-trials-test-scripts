Feature: Design forms Using Data Dictionary and Online Designer
    Form Creation: The system shall support the creation of new data collection instruments via the Online Designer.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Online Designer is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.6.7.0200.100 Create form with Online Designer
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "B.6.7.0200.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
        When I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
        And I click on the link labeled "B.6.7.0200.100"
        And I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Online Designer"
        Then I should see "Data Collection Instruments"

        #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION: Create new form
        #Oddly, we need the space before this button because otherwise we match on "Create snapshot of instruments"
        When I click on the button labeled exactly " Create"
        And I click on the last button labeled "Add instrument here"
        Then I should see "New instrument name:"
        When I enter "New Form" into the input field labeled "New instrument name:" within the data collection instrument list
        And I click on the last button labeled "Create"
        Then I should see "SUCCESS!"

        Given I click on the button labeled "Close" in the dialog box

        #VERIFY
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Instrument name | Fields |
            | Text Validation | 3      |
            | Data Types      | 45     |
            | Survey          | 2      |
            | Consent         | 4      |
            | New Form        | 0      |

        #VERIFY_LOG
        When I click on the link labeled "Logging"
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the logging table:
            | Time / Date      | Username   | Action        | List of Data Changes OR Fields Exported |
            | mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm | REDCap_admin | Manage/Design | Create data collection instrument       |
