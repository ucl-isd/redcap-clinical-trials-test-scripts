Feature: User Interface: Survey Project Settings: The system shall support tracking responders and non-responders to surveys when using the participant list.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Survey Feature is functioning as expected

  Scenario: B.3.15.1100.100 Tracking survey responders
    #ATS prerequisite: Normal users cannot move projects to production by default - let's adjust that before we proceed.
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
    And I click on the link labeled "User Settings"
    Then I should see "System-level User Settings"
    Given I select "Yes, normal users can move projects to production" on the dropdown field labeled "Allow normal users to move projects to production?"
    When I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
    And I see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"
    Then I logout

    Then I should see Project status: "Production"

    ##VERIFY_SDT
    Given I click on the link labeled "Survey Distribution Tools"
    When I click on the tab labeled "Participant List"
    Then I should see the dropdown field labeled "Participant List" with the option '"Consent" - Event 1 (Arm 1: Arm 1)' selected
    And I should see a "gray bubble" within the "1)  email@test.edu" row of the column labeled "Responded?" of the Participant List table
