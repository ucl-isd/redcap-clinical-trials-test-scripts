Feature: User Interface: Survey Project Settings: The system shall delete all survey-related information and functions including survey link, return codes and date/time stamp when disabling survey functionality. Saved data will remain unaffected.


  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Survey Feature is functioning as expected

  Scenario: B.3.15.1200.100 Deletion of meta data includes deletion of survey information and function
    ##ATS prerequisite: Normal users cannot move projects to production by default - let's adjust that before we proceed.
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
    And I click on the link labeled "User Settings"
    Then I should see "System-level User Settings"
    Given I select "Yes, normal users can move projects to production" on the dropdown field labeled "Allow normal users to move projects to production?"
    When I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
    And I see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"
    Then I logout

    #SETUP
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
    And I create a new project named "B.3.15.1200.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    #SETUP_PRODUCTION
    When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
    And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
    And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
    And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
    Then I should see Project status: "Production"

    #SETUP: DESIGNER
    Given I click on the link labeled "Designer"
    And I click on the "Enable" button for the instrument row labeled "Text Validation"
    And I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
    Then I should see the enabled survey icon link for the instrument row labeled "Text Validation"

    Given I click on the "Survey settings" button for the instrument row labeled "Text Validation"
    When I select "Yes" on the dropdown field labeled "Allow 'Save & Return Later' option for respondents?"
    And I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
    Then I should see "Your survey settings were successfully saved"

    ##VERIFY_SDT: verifying survey link and return codes are available
    Given I click on the link labeled "Survey Distribution Tools"
    And I click on the tab labeled "Participant List"
    Then I should see a button labeled "Add participants"
    And I should see the dropdown field labeled "Participant List" with the options below
      | [Initial survey] "Text Validation" - Event 1 (Arm 1: Arm 1) |
      | "Consent" - Event 1 (Arm 1: Arm 1)                          |
      | "Text Validation" - Event 2 (Arm 1: Arm 1)                  |

      | "Consent" - Event Three (Arm 1: Arm 1)                      |

    And I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
      | Email             | Record | Participant Identifier | Responded | Invitation Scheduled? | Invitation Sent ? | Link   | Survey Access Code |
      | [No email listed] |        | Disabled               | [icon]    | -                     | [icon]            | [icon] | [icon]             |
      | [No email listed] |        | Disabled               | [icon]    | -                     | [icon]            | [icon] | [icon]             |
      | email@test.edu    | 1      | Disabled               | [icon]    | -                     | [icon]            | [icon] | [icon]             |

    And I locate the bubble for the "Text Validation" instrument on event "Event 1" for record ID "1" and click on the bubble
    And I click on the button labeled "Survey options"
    And I click on the survey option label containing "Open survey" label

    #Survey

    And I clear field and enter "B.3.15.1200.100" into the data entry form field labeled "Name"
    And I click on the button labeled "Submit"
    Then I should see "Thank you for taking the survey"

    Given I click on the button labeled "Close survey"
    #And I click on the button labeled "Leave without saving changes" in the dialog box

    #MANUAL: Note that "text_validation_timestamp" is the column VARIABLE name used if Text Validation instrument was enabled as survey.
    # Cannot look for "Survey Timestamp" because that same LABEL is used for all survey timestamp columns.
    And I should NOT see "text_validation_timestamp"

    Given I click on the link labeled "Survey Distribution Tools"
