Feature: User Interface: Survey Project Settings: The system shall support tracking responders and non-responders to surveys when using the participant list.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Survey Feature is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.3.15.1100.100 Tracking survey responders

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
        And I create a new project named "B.3.15.1100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION

        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box
        Then I should see "Project status: Production"

        ##VERIFY_SDT
        Given I click on the link labeled "Survey Distribution Tools"
        And I click on the button labeled "Participant List"
        Then I should see "Participant List"

        Then I should see a grey bubble for the column labeled "Responded?" for record "1"
        And I should see a grey bubble for the column labeled "Responded?" for record "2"
