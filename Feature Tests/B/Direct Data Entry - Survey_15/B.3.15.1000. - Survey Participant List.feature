  Scenario:  B.3.15.1000.100 Distribution tools for longitudinal project
    #SETUP
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    And I create a new project named "B.3.15.1000.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    #SETUP_PRODUCTION

    And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
    And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
    And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
    Then I should see Project status: "Production"
