    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Draft mode is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.4.20.0800.100 Flag critical warnings
        ##ATS prerequisite: Normal users cannot move projects to production by default - let's adjust that before we proceed.
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        And I click on the link labeled "User Settings"
        Then I should see "System-level User Settings"
        Given I select "Yes, normal users can move projects to production" on the dropdown field labeled "Allow normal users to move projects to production?"
        When I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
        And I see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"
        Then I logout

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
