Feature: User Interface: The E-signature and Locking Management tool shall display all records in a database with their status as locked or e-signed for all data entry forms.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Record locking and E-signatures is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.2.19.100.100 Display locked and e-signed status

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
        And I create a new project named "C.2.19.100.100 LTS 14.5.26" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
        Then I should see Project status: "Production"

        #SETUP
        When I click on the link labeled "Customize & Manage Locking/E-signatures"
        And I click on the button labeled "I understand. Let me make changes" in the dialog box
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the table:
            | Display the Lock option for this instrument? | Data Collection Instrument | Also display E-signature option on instrument? |                           |
