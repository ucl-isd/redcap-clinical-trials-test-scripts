Feature: User Interface: The system shall support limiting file repository user view access and export rights.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that file repository is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.3.26.200.100 Limit user view and export access based on User Rights and DAG

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
        When I create a new project named "C.3.26.200.100 LTS 14.5.26" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
        And I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
        And I click on the link labeled "C.3.26.200.100"
