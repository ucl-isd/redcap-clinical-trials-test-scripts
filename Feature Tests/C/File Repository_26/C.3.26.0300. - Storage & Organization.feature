    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that file repository is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.3.26.300.100 Automatic uploading of data export logs into the data export folder

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
        And I create a new project named "C.3.26.300.100 LTS 14.5.26" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
        And I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
        And I click on the link labeled "A.3.26.300.100 LTS 14.5.26"

        #SETUP Export data automatically placed in file repo
        Given I click on the link labeled "Data Exports, Reports, and Stats"

        And I click on the button labeled "Export Data" in the dialog box
        Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Data export was successful!"

        Given I click on the download icons to receive the files for the "CSV / Microsoft Excel (raw data)" format in the dialog box
        Then I should have a csv file
