Feature: User Interface: The system shall support limiting a rule viewing that references a field to only users with access rights.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data Quality Module is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.4.18.1400.100 User access limit rule viewing
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "C.4.18.1400.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project418.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box
        Then I should see Project status: "Production"

        #USER_RIGHTS: add two users with diff access levels
        When I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
        And I enter "Test_User1" into the field with the placeholder text of "Assign new user to role"
        And I click on the button labeled "Assign to role"
        And I select "1_FullRights" on the dropdown field labeled "Select Role" on the role selector dropdown
        And I click on the button labeled exactly "Assign" on the role selector dropdown
        Then I should see "Test User1" within the "1_FullRights" row of the column labeled "Username" of the User Rights table

        When I enter "Test_User2" into the field with the placeholder text of "Assign new user to role"
        And I click on the button labeled "Assign to role"
        And I select "4_NoAccess_Noexport" on the dropdown field labeled "Select Role" on the role selector dropdown
        And I click on the button labeled exactly "Assign" on the role selector dropdown
        Then I should see "Test User2" within the "4_NoAccess_Noexport" row of the column labeled "Username" of the User Rights table

        And I logout

        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
        And I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
        And I click on the link labeled "C.4.18.1400"
        And I click on the link labeled "Data Quality"
        Then I should see "Data Quality Rules"
