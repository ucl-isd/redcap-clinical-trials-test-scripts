Feature: User Interface: The system shall provide default rules after installation of the application.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data Quality Module is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.4.18.0100.100 Default data quality rules
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "REDCap_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "C.4.18.0100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project418.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
        Then I should see Project status: "Production"

        #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION
        When I click on the link labeled "Data Quality"
        Then I should see "Data Quality Rules"
        And I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Rule # | Rule Name                                                                 | Rule Logic (Show discrepancy  only if...) |
