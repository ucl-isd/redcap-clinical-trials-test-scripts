        When I click on the link labeled "Data Quality"
        Then I should see "Data Quality Rules"

        When I enter "Integer" into the textarea field labeled "Enter descriptive name for new rule"
        And I click on "" in the textarea field labeled "Enter logic for new rule"
        And I wait for 1 minute
        And I clear field and enter "[integer]<>'1999'" in the textarea field labeled "Logic Editor" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "Update & Close Editor" in the dialog box
        And I check the checkbox labeled "Execute in real time on data entry forms"
        And I click on the button labeled "Add"
