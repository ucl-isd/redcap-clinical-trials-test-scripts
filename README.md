# Regulatory & Software Validation Committee (RSVC)

Welcome to the Regulatory and Software Validation Committee (RSVC) GitHub repository. This repository is dedicated to hosting automated validation test scripts for REDCap's core functionality, as developed and maintained by our automated testing subcommittee.

## About RSVC

The Regulatory and Software Validation Committee (RSVC) is a dedicated group committed to ensuring regulatory compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E6(R2) and The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Part 11 regulations while validating the core functionality of REDCap. Our committee compiles valuable resources, creates step-by-step feature tests, and provides a platform for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Automated Validation Test Scripts

Within this repository, you will find a collection of validation test scripts meticulously crafted by the Regulatory and Software Validation committee.
