REDCap Regulatory &amp; Software Validation Committee (RSVC) - Automated validation feature test scripts

# Regulatory & Software Validation Committee (RSVC)

Welcome to the Regulatory and Software Validation Committee (RSVC) GitHub repository. This repository is dedicated to hosting automated validation test scripts for REDCap's core functionality, as developed and maintained by our automated testing subcommittee.

## About RSVC

The Regulatory and Software Validation Committee (RSVC) is a dedicated group committed to ensuring regulatory compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E6(R2) and The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Part 11 regulations while validating the core functionality of REDCap. Our committee compiles valuable resources, creates step-by-step feature tests, and provides a platform for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Automated Validation Test Scripts

Within this repository, you will find a collection of validation test scripts meticulously crafted by the Regulatory and Software Validation committee. These scripts are designed to assess and validate REDCap's core functionality comprehensively. Consortium partners and REDCap users can utilize these scripts to ensure the robustness and compliance of their REDCap installations.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions and collaboration from the REDCap community and regulatory compliance enthusiasts. If you have expertise in regulatory compliance, validation, or REDCap, feel free to join our efforts by contributing to this repository.

Thank you for your interest in ensuring the quality and compliance of REDCap through manual validation test scripts. Together, we can enhance the reliability of REDCap for critical research and clinical projects.

## Testing Contribution

UCL Clinical Trials Shared Platforms is conducting these tests manually in December 2024 for the initial validation of our package of REDCap. Tests will be conducted by Nancy Tappenden, Andrew Cooper, and Sven Nelson. Nancy will be performing tests within the [Production environment](https://redcap-clinical-trials.ucl.ac.uk/), Andrew in the [Testing environment](https://redcap-clinical-trials-uat.ucl.ac.uk/), and Sven in the [Development environment](https://redcap-clinical-trials-dev.ucl.ac.uk/)
